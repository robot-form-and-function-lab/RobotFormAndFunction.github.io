									MS in Robotics<br />
									B.Tech Electronics - University of Allahabad<br />
									Hey! I am Shashwat Singh, currently pursuing a master's degree in robotics. Taking inspiration from biology to solve open challenges in designing microrobots with better mechanisms, actuation, and computational capabilities drives my interest in research. At the moment, I'm working on Buffalo Bytes, a highly mobile microrobot, and an autonomous jumping microrobot. Besides building cool robots, I enjoy working out, singing, and playing guitar.</p>

									MS Robotics Engineering<br />
									Hello, I'm Aniket, a robotics graduate currently working on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and exploring the exciting world of autonomous flight. In addition to my work on MAVs, I'm also passionate about creating robots that can interact with humans in new and innovative ways. Recently, I've been working on a small robot puppy project, which involves designing and building a miniature robotic dog that can mimic the movements and behaviors of a real puppy. Outside of my work, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I'm committed to making a positive impact on the world through my work in robotics. </p>

									BS Aerospace Engineering<br />
									I'm currently majoring in aerospace engineering with a particular interest in quadcopters and spacecraft. I'm currently invested in researching the use of micro-robotics applications on micro-aircraft and quadcopters as well as anything to do with using nature and the natural world as inspiration for engineering pursuits in all subsets of engineering. I'm also a big fan of taking care of and learning about my plants or playing my saxophone when I have the time.</p>
