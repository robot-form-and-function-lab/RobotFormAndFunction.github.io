								<h3> July 2024</h3>
							</header>

								Congratulations to Vasilisa Ignatova for winning the Dean's Undergraduate Achievement Award in the School of Enginering and Applied Science at the University at Buffalo, this award honors exceptional undergraduate students who have distinguished themselves through excellence in research and related technical presentations/publications. Congratulations!

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/news/Singh_Unconventional_robotics.jpg" alt="" width="250"/></span>
								Shashwat Singh won the Best Poster Award at the Unconventional Robotics workshop at ICRA 2024. Shahswat presented his work on a multi-modal, spring-tail inspired microrobot. 
							<br>

								Vasilisa presented her research on tactile communication in small-scale, resource-constrained robots at the 2024 Celebration of Student Academic Excellence. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Her work aims to enable communication between humans and robots or robots and robots through a sense of touch, allowing for a new methodology of passing information without wireless communication methods like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. </p>

								<h3>April 2024</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/news/ASmith_ArtOfResearch.jpg" alt="" width="250"/></span>
								Audra Smith presented a photograph of her research at the 2024 Art of Research competition at the Buffalo Museum of Science. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Her photograph is of a 3D printed part, shortly after emerging from the resin bath. It is made from a thick liquid resin, which is solidified (via laser) in layers as it is lifted out of a vat. The image appears upside down; It is, because the part was created with its base at the top in order for the resin to drip off during printing.
								<br>
								<br>
								The 3D printed part serves as a body for a robot which is inspired by slime molds. Each of these individual cells will be equipped with one vibration motor as its sole method of movement. Changes in the speed of the spin at different times or angles allows the part to move in any direction. They will be programmed to interact with their neighbors, Allowing for these robots to move as one body.
